Meta.Azure.Provisioning is a meta-package containing all of the Azure.Provisioning.* packages, built using the most up-to-date Azure.ResourceManager.* packages.

The official Azure.Provisioning.* packages are not up to date, meaning that newer version of bicep resources cannot be constructed using the existing packages, as the types don't exist.

Use this package as a replacement.
